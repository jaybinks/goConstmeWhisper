Status is Working, but not complete. (It works for my usecase)

# Todo Items
## General
- Wrap whisper.go in a class
- check whisper.dll exists, protect from errors loading the dll
- lots of tidyup
- Cleanup syscalls to all be SyscallN

## Testing
- How about we have some?

## IMediaFoundation
- Properly implement stero in LoadAudio* calls
